# âœ… FIXED & READY FOR DEMO

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Staff Update Functionality** âœ…
**Problem**: Staff couldn't update baggage status  
**Root Cause**: API response structure mismatch  
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` line 126 to extract `baggage` from response  

### 2. **Hydration Warning** âœ…
**Problem**: Console error from browser extensions (Grammarly)  
**Fix**: Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to body tag in `layout.tsx`

### Quick Test (2 minutes):

2. **You're already logged in as John Baggage (staff1)**
   - Perfect! Ready to test

3. **Click "Update" on Emma Davis (BAG-F781DD59)**
   - Currently shows "Loaded"
   
4. **In the modal**:
   - Change status to: **"In Flight"**
   - Location: **"Airborne"**
